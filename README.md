# Custom Design Manager for STAR-CCM+ FSAE Style CFD Simulations

## Justifications

- StarCCM's built in Design mangager is difficult to setup and unreliable
- This allows us to better suit our avaliable HPC resources
- Allows for much better error handling and logging
- Can use whatever DOE method works best for us

## Plan

- Goal to recreate STAR-CCM+'s version
- Version 0.5.0 is aimed to run a Pareto Front study (goal Jan 05)
- Version 1.0.0 will be able to handle performance assessments and optimization studies (goal Jan 26)
